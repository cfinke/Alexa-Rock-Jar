Enable the skill.

There are four areas of interaction:

1. Adding rocks.

Say "Tell Rock Jar to give Jim a rock." Alexa should say, "Ok, I've added one rock to Jim's jar. Jim now has 1 rock."

Say "Tell Rock Jar to give Jim five rocks." Alexa should say, "Ok, I've added five rocks to Jim's jar. Jim now has 6 rocks."

2. Removing rocks.

Say "Tell Rock Jar to take a rock out of Jim's jar." Alexa should say, "Ok, I've removed one rock from Jim's jar. Jim now has 5 rocks."

3. Counting the number of rocks.

Say "Ask Rock Jar how many rocks Jim has." Alexa should say, "Jim has 5 rocks."

4. Empty a jar.

Say "Tell Rock Jar to empty Jim's jar." Alexa should say, "Ok, I've taken all five rocks out of Jim's jar."

The skill also implements the Help intent.

The Help intent and the Counting intent are the only ones that generate a card in the app.
