Rock Jar
========
This skill allows you to keep virtual voice-controlled rock jars.

A rock jar is a method for tracking children's behavior. Rocks are added for good behavior and removed for bad behavior. When the jar is full (or reaches a certain number of rocks), the child can exchange the rocks for a reward.
